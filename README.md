# Blockchain Sneakers Authentication
The sneakers market is one of the most important trends nowadays. Besides the usual market, the reselling one is born: companies such as Nike or Adidas put on the market a limited number of sneakers per model, and people try to buy them not only for themselves but often to resell them to a higher price. This new market has brought about counterfeiting problems. To overcome this problem we propose an authentication system based on blockchain. Each sneaker is associated with a QR Code which is linked to the immutable information contained in the blockchain. In addition to that we create an associated NFT to add uniqueness to the product. This NFT is generated with a style transfer that tries to combine the sneakers' image and an artwork generated by a Generative Adversarial Network.
